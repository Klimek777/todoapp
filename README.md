# todoapp

### Short description
This to-do app allows users to manage their daily tasks. Users can add a task by providing a task name and an optional short description. On the home page, users can see how many tasks they have done or still have to do. Completed tasks change to the grey color, making them easy to recognize. Users can delete tasks by sliding them to the left and clicking the delete button. When the list of tasks is empty, users can see the message 'ALL DONE! Add some new tasks' for information. Tasks are saved on the device using local storage, thanks to Hive.

### Used dependencies:
- flutter_slidable
